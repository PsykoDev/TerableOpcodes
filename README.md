# TerableOpcodes
Opcodes for the modules I use

Make sure to drop files in the \map\ folder into your proxy's \node_modules\tera-data\map\ folder

I personally acquire and verify the NA Opcodes, the other regions(EU/RU/TW/SEA) opcodes are obtained from other people and are not verified by me

If you'd like to contribute some opcodes, post them in the #opcodes channel https://discord.gg/huycMsa

## Usage
### `terao region`

### `terao regionu`
